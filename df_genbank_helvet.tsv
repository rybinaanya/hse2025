17993529		Yes	dairy, cheese	mobile genetic elements are major contributing factors to the generation of genetic diversity in prokaryotic organisms. for example, insertion sequence (is) elements have been shown to specifically contribute to niche adaptation by promoting a variety of genetic rearrangements. the complete genome s...
